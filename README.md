# Wazuh Server install on Ubuntu V’box. Agent install on home laptop…with some hiccups
Goal is to mimic a small, localized SIEM deployment and kick off the server to capture data coming through my home laptop. From there, monitory, identify and potentially triage or remediate threats or concerns
Step 1 - Download and install the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on a virtual box machine.

For the Wazuh installation, I followed their Quickstart all-in-one installation commands. You want to be very cognizant of their requirements and operating system guidelines. Not meeting these requirements could have the installation fail or not perform as designed.
